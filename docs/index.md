  tagline: Wraps lychee with state tracking — every linked asset on a page, every run, diffed and logged.

features:
  - title: Waterfall-level monitoring
    details: Checks every CSS, JS, image, and external URL referenced on a page — not just whether the server returns 200.
  - title: Stable diffs across runs
    details: Normalizes lychee output (strips timing, sorts arrays) so the hash only changes when something real changes.
  - title: State tracking + diffs
    details: Stores a snapshot per URL. On change, prints a unified diff showing exactly which assets flipped status.
  - title: VictoriaMetrics metrics
    details: Appends total/ok/error/redirect counts as JSONL time series — ready to ingest into any metrics stack.
